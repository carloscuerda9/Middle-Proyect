This is Ironhack's **mid-bootcamp project**, developed and (not-yet)completed .


## Objectives:

**Ironhack objectives:**
* Build a model that will **predict the price** of a vehicle based on features provided in the dataset.
* Use **business intelligence** tools to explore the characteristics of the vehicle.

**Objectives:**
* **Model Selection Mastery** Gain proficiency in understanding and selecting appropriate regression models for different datasets. Explore and compare various linear regression models, understanding their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for specific types of data.
* **Feature Engineering Expertise** Develop expertise in feature engineering by exploring techniques to identify, select, and preprocess relevant features for predicting car prices. Understand the impact of feature selection on model performance and refine strategies for handling different types of data.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning Proficiency** Acquire proficiency in hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of linear regression models. Experiment with adjusting hyperparameters, such as learning rates or regularization terms, and grasp how these adjustments influence the accuracy and generalization of predictions.
* Have fun ! :)

## Project development:

**Project deadline:** 05 days (between 25/02/24 and 1/03/24)

## Folder Structure:

- **Raw Data:**
  - CSV file containing the original unprocessed data.

- **Cleaned Data:**
  - CSV file with cleaned and prepared data for the machine learning model.

- **Notebooks:**
  1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering:**
      - First notebook dedicated to exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.

  2. **Regression Model Selection:**
      - Second notebook focused on the choice and tuning of the linear regression model.

  3. **Results and Price Calculator Model:**
      - Last notebook presenting the obtained results and the final model of the price calculator.
